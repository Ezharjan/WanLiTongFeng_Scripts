# WanLiTongFengScripts
Scripts of a Reigns-like computer game made via Unity.

WanLiTongFeng is a kind of text game whose design was inspired by the card game Reigns which depends on the player’s choice to keep certain values within certain range in order to keep alive during the play. Its main goal is quite clear that the player who is able to sustain the value of the People, Military, Policy and Economy in certain amount for a certain time can win while those who lose any one of them may fail. The player must choose carefully in order to balance the four elements’ value. As we also hope to make the game interesting and full of cultural significance and value, we integrated the game with the traditional Chinese culture and provided 50 independent events with 10 more contextual stories base on the background of ancient Chinese world view with unrealistic backdrop. The operation is quite simple and clear that the player can click either side of the curtain to choose when an event is shown on the screen and click any place to continue to the next event. The player can go back to the main menu if the game is over. The player’s choice may directly influence any of the value of the four elements including the People, the Policy, the Military and the Economy, the player can win the game after 30 rounds of playing, meaning that the game ends with WanLiTongFeng.

万里同风是一款文字类游戏。其设计灵感来自于卡牌游戏<<王权>>，即使玩家通过抉择，来保持某些数值在特定范围内。游戏目标清晰简介，能够坚持一定的时长而不使民心，军力，政治或财富中的任意一个将至零点即可。因此，玩家需要谨慎进行抉择，以维持四项数值的平衡。另外，我们希望结合中国传统文化，因此在架空的，以中国古代为背景的世界观上为玩家提供了达50个随机事件，10个左右的连续事件，使游戏变得有趣而富有一定的文化意义与价值。 玩家的操作方式简单明了：放出现某个事件时，通过鼠标点击画面两侧出现的任一卷轴即可进行抉择；当抉择的结果展现后，玩家再次点击任意位置即可获取到下一事件。另外，当游戏成功或失败后，再次点击屏幕即可返回主菜单。 应注意：玩家的选择会影响民心，军力，政治或财富中的一项或多项，玩家应努力避免其中任意一项降到零点并维持30个回合，即可获得"万里同风"的胜利结局。
